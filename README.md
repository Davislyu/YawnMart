## Introduction

YawnMart is an e-commerce platform that brings you the most mundane shopping experience. It's built as a personal project to showcase my web development skills and to complete my GitHub profile. We might not have reinvented the wheel, but we sure had fun building it! üò¥

## Features

- üõí **Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products (yawn).
- üîê **Authentication**: Secure login and registration system (because security is important, even in boring projects).
- üóÇÔ∏è **Category Management**: Organize products into categories (we need some order in the chaos).
